# Object-detection

Object detection is a computer technology related to computer vision and image processing that deals with detecting instances of semantic objects of a certain class (such as humans, buildings, or cars) in digital images and videos.

In this project I have used mobilenet ssd and have written the code to detect various objects from the input video.
